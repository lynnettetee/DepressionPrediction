# DepressionPrediction

Three multiclassification models, Multinomial Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest were used to predict depression severity on a self-collected dataset. Please read from `Predicting_Depression_Severity.ipynb`.

As the notebook was written on Google Colab (Colaboratory), the tables and plots are not correctly formattted in Jupyter if viewed on GitHub. It is most reccommended that you view the notebook on Colab instead as key plots do not appear on the Jupyter version.
